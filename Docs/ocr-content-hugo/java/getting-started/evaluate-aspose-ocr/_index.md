You can easily download an evaluation version of Aspose.OCR for Java from the [download page](http://maven.aspose.com/repository/simple/ext-release-local/com/aspose/aspose-ocr/). The evaluation version provides the same capabilities as the licensed version of the component. Furthermore, evaluation version simply becomes licensed when you purchase a license and add a couple of lines of code to apply the license.

The evaluation version of Aspose.OCR (that is, the component running without a license applied) limits the number of characters extracted from an image to 50.

If you want to try Aspose.OCR without evaluation version limitations, you can also request a 30-day temporary license. Please refer to [How to get a Temporary License?](http://www.aspose.com/corporate/purchase/temporary-license.aspx) for more information.
