**Welcome to Aspose.OCR for C++**

Aspose.OCR for C++ is a native C++ library that allows developers to add OCR functionality to their applications without requiring any additional tool or API. Aspose.OCR for C++ allows extracting text from images having different fonts and styles - saving the time and effort involved in developing an OCR solution from scratch.

## **Product Description**
Aspose OCR for C++ uses deep learning networks under the hood which means the solution is more reliable to differentiate noises on the image as compared to the classic cv approaches. The SDK itself works offline which is also important for some business applications. One of the main features of the library is the text fragment detection which enables it to recognize paragraphs and headers even if some pictures or tables are present on the page (unlike modern OCR engines based on classic cv approaches).
