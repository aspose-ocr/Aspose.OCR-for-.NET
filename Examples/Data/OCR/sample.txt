More than one analysis is shown for wells UE-25b%1, USW H-1, USW VH-1, and
UE-29a/2.  The multiple analyses permit a comparison of water compositions as
a function of volume of water pumped. The sample obtained on July 20, 1982,
from UE- 25b+1 was collected after 28 days of pumping of an interva1 863 to
875 m below the land surface (Daniels and others, 1982). This interval was
i solated using inflatable packers. We11 USW H-1 was first sampled on
October 20, 1980, after drilling to a depth of 687
