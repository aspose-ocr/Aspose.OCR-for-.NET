Aspose.OCR for .NET is a commercial product, but our philosophy is to develop it using our unique "open-source feel" approach. In other words, we at Aspose are extremely customer driven and this shows in:
+ Frequent releases (at least 1 a month).
+ Features are prioritized according to your requests.
+ Unlimited free technical support for anyone.
+ Helpful support in the forums and answers within 12-24 hours.
+ Live chat with experienced technical advisors.
 
We think that customers who use our products feel that they use an open source product because of the extent they can influence the project, but with the security of a fully committed talented team working on the project.
